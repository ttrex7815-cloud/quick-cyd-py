# a. write a function is_even that returns whether a number is even or not

# b. write a function is_odd that returns whether a number is odd or not
#    can you write this function using the is_even function?

# c. write a function greet(name) that returns a greeting string like
#    "Hello, <name>!" and handles an empty name by returning "Hello!".

# d. write a function multiply_list(vals, factor) that returns a new list
#    where each numeric element of vals is multiplied by factor.

# e. write a function write_triangle(height) that writes out a right triangle
#    made of asterisks ('*'). The first line should have one *, the second line
#    should have two **, etc stop when you have written the number of lines specified
#    by the height param. So write_triangle(3) would print
#    *
#    **
#    ***
#    And write_triangle(5) would print
#    *
#    **
#    ***
#    ****
#    *****
